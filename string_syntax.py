phrase = "Hello world"  # Variables aren't declared in Python. It is a dynamically typed language.

# note: '\' is an escape character which allows for typing characters that might break a code. ex: ( ) \ / " ' :

print(phrase)  # Prints variable 'phrase'.

print(phrase + "!")  # Concatenation! Combining two strings.
